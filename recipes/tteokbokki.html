        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tteokbokki is a traditional Korean street food made with spicy stir-fried rice cakes as well as other ingredients such as fish cakes, eggs, anchovies, and onion.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound of cylinder shaped rice cake (use more if you're not adding eggs or fish cakes)</li>
            <li>4 cups of water</li>
            <li>7 large size dried anchovies</li>
            <li>6 x 8 inch dried kelp</li>
            <li>1/3 cup gochujang (hot pepper paste)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon gochugaru (hot pepper flakes)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>3 green onions, cut into 3-inch long pieces</li>
            <li>2 hard boiled eggs, shelled</li>
            <li>1/2 pound fish cakes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the water, dried anchovies, and dried kelp to a shallow pot or pan.</li>
            <li>Boil for 15 minutes over medium high heat without the lid.</li>
            <li>Combine hot pepper paste, hot pepper flakes, and sugar in a small bowl. Remove the anchovies and kelp from the pot and add the rice cake, the mixture in the bowl, the green onion, and the optional fish cakes and hard boiled eggs. The stock will be about 2 1/2 cups.</li>
            <li>Stir gently with a wooden spoon when it starts to boil. Keep stirring until the rice cake turns soft and the sauce thickens and looks shiny, which should take 10-15 minutes. If the rice cake is not soft enough, add more water and continue stirring until softened.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and serve hot.</li> 
        </ol>
